**Estimated time:** 1 hour

Congratulations on your new role as the Full Stack Application Developer at `Best Cars` dealership.

As part of the project, your first task is to run and test its main Django application. You are given a skeleton of the Django application as a starting point.

Then, you need to complete the following steps to add additional static pages.


>The lab environment doesn\'t store your changes. If you are going to leave your workspace in between, it is highly recommended that you push any changes you make to git.

<details><summary> Click here for the procedure to push your changes into Git repo </summary>

```
git config --global user.email "yourgithub@email.com"
```

```
git config --global user.name "name"
```

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m"Adding temporary changes to Github"
```

```
git push
```

</details>

::page{title="Fork and Clone the Repository"}

- Open [link](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/xrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone.git) and create a fork of the repository that includes essential starter code required for this project. Ensure you keep the same repository name when you fork it

- Go to your forked repository and open the `README.md` and add the project name in the file as `fullstack_developer_capstone`. Ensure you use this exact name as this is required for the AI-graded submission


- Copy the git clone URL of the skeleton repository that you forked into your account by selecting copy icon

> **Note:** **Ensure you copy your repository by checking the URL in the address bar.**

- Select **New terminal**

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-CD0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module_1_static_pages/images/new-terminal.png" style="margin:.5cm; border: solid 1px grey">

- Clone the URL you copied in step 3.
```
git clone <your_repo_name>
```

#### Assessment:
 
**For Option 1: AI-Graded Submission and Evaluation:** Copy and paste the the public Github URL of  the `README.md` and save it in a text file for the Final Project Submission and Evaluation.
 
**For Option 2: Peer-Graded Submission and Evaluation:** Copy and paste the the public Github URL and save it in a text file for Peer Assignment.

::page{title="Run the Django App on Development Server"}

- Observe the folder structure of the Django app skeleton structure. You will see `server` folder with three sub-folders:
  - `djangoapp`: Contains the django application
  - `djangoproj`: Contains the project configuration
  - `frontend`: HTML and CSS and React front end

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-CD0321EN-Coursera/labs/v2/m1/images/folder_struct.png" style="margin:.5cm; border: solid 1px grey;width:75%">

Next, let\'s setup the Python runtime in Theia and test the app.

- Change to the `server` directory in the terminal

```
cd xrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone/server
```

- Set up virtual environment for your Django application to run in

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv djangoenv
source djangoenv/bin/activate
```
- Install the necessary Python packages in your virtual environment. The package names have already been provided in `requirements.txt`.

```
python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

- In `server/djangoproj/settings.py`, under `TEMPLATES`, you will find `DIRS` as an empty list. Add the `os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'frontend/static')` to the list for the Django application to recognize the front-end static files. It should be set up as below.

```python
        'DIRS': [
            os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'frontend/static')
        ],

```

- In the same file, `server/djangoproj/settings.py`, add the directory for the Django application to look for static files at the bottom of the file

```
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'frontend/static')
]

```

- Perform migrations to create necessary tables
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

- Run migration to activate models for the app

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

- Start the local development server
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Great! You should have the Django app running now.

#### Assessment:

**For Option 1: AI-Graded Submission and Evaluation:** Copy and paste the terminal output and save it in a text file named `django_server` for the final project submission and evaluation

**For Option 2: Peer-Graded Submission and Evaluation:** Please take a screenshot of the console or terminal output to show that your app is running successfully, and store it as `django_server.png` or `django_server.jpeg` for peer review.

- Select the `Django Application` button below to open the application. You will see the static homepage that is rendered. Copy the URL from the browser.

>The links in the page will not work as yet.

::startApplication{port="8000" display="external" name="Django Application" route="/"}

<details><summary> If the page doesn't open, select here to open the URL manually. </summary>

Select the Skills Network button on the right, it will open the "Skills Network Toolbox". Then select `OTHER` then `Launch Application`. From there you should be able to enter the port as `8000` and launch the development server.

- On the file editor, open the `server/djangoproj/settings.py` in the editor and set the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to reflect your Django app\'s root URL.

>Please do not included the `/` at the end.

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=['localhost','<your application URL here>']
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=['<your application URL here>']
```

::page{title="Add 'About Us' Page"}

- Open `server/frontend/static/About.html` in the editor.

- You have been provided with the stylesheet `style.css` in the same folder. In the `<head>` tag inside `About.html` link the stylesheet for use in the HTML file.

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/bootstrap.min.css">
```

- Paste the following content in the `<div>` tag named `about-header`.

```html
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  Welcome to Best Cars dealership, home to the best cars in North America. We deal in selling domestic and imported cars at reasonable prices.
```
>You can add additional information that might be relevant to this page.

- Change the image `person.png` to an actual person\'s image and change all the text in `About.html` to look more realistic. Change the styling as per your preference.

- Go to `djangoproj/urls.py` and add the following to the `urlpatterns`.

```python
    path('about/', TemplateView.as_view(template_name="About.html")),
```

- The Django server automatically restarts.  Select button below and check if the changes are reflected.

::startApplication{port="8000" display="external" name="Dealership Application" route="/about"}

<details><summary> If the page doesn't open, select here to open the URL manually. </summary>

Select the Skills Network button on the right, it will open the "Skills Network Toolbox". Then select `OTHER` then `Launch Application`. From there you should be able to enter the port as `8000` and launch the development server.

Once the application is running on port 8000, append /about to the URL to view the About page.

::page{title="Add 'Contact Us' Page"}

- Under `server/frontend/static` folder, add a new file named `Contact.html`

- Add the style sheets link

- Add the header navigation bar, with `Contact Us` as the active link

- Write the contact information content in the file. You can be creative and make up your information. Use css to style it.

- Add the `contact` path to `djangproj/urls.py`.

```
    path('contact/', TemplateView.as_view(template_name="Contact.html")),
```

- The Django server automatically restarts.  Select the button below and check if the `contact` page renders

::startApplication{port="8000" display="external" name="Dealership Application" route="/contact"}

<details><summary> If the page doesn't open, select here to open the URL manually. </summary>

Select the Skills Network button on the right, it will open the "Skills Network Toolbox". Then select `OTHER` then `Launch Application`. From there you should be able to enter the port as `8000` and launch the development server.
